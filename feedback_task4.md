## General

Your code and files are readable and well structured. Nice.
Also using the correct meta tags and html attributes is a big plus.


## Design

I really like your design by the looks. When it comes to funcionality there are some glitches. On smaller screens you have a double vertical scrollbar, as the page as well as the content will scroll. If thats because of the background, checkout the *background-attachment: fixed;* property.
